    <h5>Runtime Environment</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Fundamentally, a runtime environment is software that allows you to execute code. It contains the means of
      letting your code you write interact with your computer to do whatever it is you have designed it to do. For our
      purposes today we will be starting off simple: we will make it so our Javascript code writes different messages or
      outputs for us in the terminal</p>
    <br>
  <h5>What does it mean to compile</h5>
    <br>
    <p>When we write our code it is understandable (usually) by us developers, but not by the computer. Compiling code
      is the process of turning what we have written into executable instructions by the computer. The runtime
      environment helps with this process.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>VSC Basics</h5>
    <br>
    <p>There are a few basic components to Visual Studio Code you should be aware of.</p>
    <h5>The Explorer</h5>
    <p>this window is where you can see what folder you have open, the sub-folders (sometimes called sub-directories)
      inside of it, and the various files stored inside of the directory and sub-directories</p>
    <br>
    <h5>The Workspace</h5>
    <br>
    <p>This is the window I am currently typing in. You can have multiple files open at a time, and vsc will create tabs
      for them at the top of the workspace window. If a tab has a white dot next to its name it means that it has
      unsaved changes. To save your files you can either click ctr + s for each file, or you can save all by going to
      the file option at the top of the vsc window and choosing the save all option (you can also save files
      individually this way).
    </p>
    <br>
  </section>
  <section class="section-two">
    <h5 style="color:black;">The terminal</h5>
    <br>
    <p>We will be using a terminal to actually run our code that we write. We can also use it to navigate our
      directories, create files, even write/edit files if need be.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Extensions</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Part of the reason VSC has become so popular is because it is very easy to add extension to VSC to make it do
      what you want it to do. For instance, there is an extension that makes sure VSC is using the most up-to-date
      Javascript so that you don't accidentally use depricated(old) code. There are many other extensions we will be
      using as the training goes along</p>
    <br>
    <h5>All together: IDE</h5>
    <br>
    <p>An Integrated Development Environment is software that helps with writing code. Usually, an IDE will contain
      features that give intelisense (helpful hints) for your code, provide error messages if you write bad code
      (warnings) and will usually provide a way of executing your code.</p>

        Definitions (May31)</a></h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Variable Scope</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The Variable scope defines the lifetime and visibility of a variable. Each variable associated with a scope. The
      variable can be accessed only within its scope.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Global Scope</h5>
    <br>
    Variables defined outside any function, block, or module have global scope. The global scope variables are accessed
    everywhere in the application.
    The global variable's lifetime is throughout the application.
    <h5>Local Scope</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Local Scope used to refer to Function-local scope, but following the introduction of block scope, this term is
      considered ambiguous and should not be used. The local scope has divided into the function scope, the block scope
      and the lexical scope. The block scope concept is introduced in ECMA Script 6 (ES6) together with the new ways to
      declare variables - const and let.
      The variable declared in a function is only visible inside that function. var is the keyword to define variable
      for a function-scope accessibility. These variables cannot be accessed or modified.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>Block Scope</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Block scope is the scope of the variables declared inside the {} (curly brackets). In ES6, const and let keywords
      allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the
      corresponding block.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Lexical Scope</h5>
    <br>
    <p>Block scope is the scope of the variables declared inside the {} (curly brackets). In ES6, const and let keywords
      allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the
      corresponding block.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>Hoisting</h5>
    <br>
    <p>In JavaScript, variable declarations made with var and function declarations made with the function keyword are
      hoisted - or moved - to the top of the scope in which they are declared when the JavaScript interpreter parses the
      code. This means that variables and functions can be used before they are even declared as shown below.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://app.revature.com/curriculum/16569/batch/1259/viewCalendar" target="_blank">Week 1 Revature Pro
        Questions</a></h2>
    <br>
    <h5>Data Types</h5>
    <br>
    <p class="def_mod_one">A datatype is just what it sounds like; it describes the kind or type of a piece of
      information.Typically a programming language starts off with some really basic datatypes and then sometimes has
      the ability to define more complex datatypes from there.

      A language might begin with the types number, text, boolean(True/False) and then build to allow for a Collection
      of Numbers, or a datatype with a text portion and a number portion. How these different types are defined is going
      to be specific to the language itself.</p>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5>Writing a program </h5>
    <br>
    <span>Where do I start?</span>
     <p>To answer the first question, start with creating requirements. Requirements are specifications on what the
      software you are building should do. For personal projects, you should create your own requirements; at work, you
      will be given the requirements to implement. For example, let's say you are building a command line application
      that works as a calculator.</p>
    <br>
    
    The first step would be to list out exactly what you would like the software to do -
      think in terms of inputs and outputs:
    <ul>
      <li>
        I can start the calculator app on the command line and it should greet me with a message
      </li>
      <li>
        The calculator should have an optional flag which restricts it to only accept positive values
      </li>
      <li>
        I should be able to enter any two real numbers and select an operator and the calculator should return the result
      </li>
      <li>
        The calculator should present me with an error when I attempt to divide by           zero
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Writing the Code</h2>
    <p> Once you have a solid list of requirements, start writing the code! For more advanced projects, you would
      probably want to start with a high level design, but for simple projects like our calculator it is fine to jump
      straight to programming. Start with the easiest and most straightforward way to write code that satisfies your
      requirements. Do not worry about how pretty the code is or if it is even good code at this point. The iterative
      process to follow when building an application is:
    <ul>
      <li>Make it work (meet the requirements)</li>
      <li>Make it right (improve how the code is written)</li>
      <li>Make it fast (optimize performance)</li>
    </ul>
    While implementing your features, you may realize that you missed something in the requirements. For example, your
    calculator app does not handle decimal values properly, instead it always rounds them. You will probably catch these
    problems while testing out and experimenting with your project. Once you identify the problem (or bug), a good
    practice is to write a unit test case for this scenario. Every language has multiple testing libraries you can
    explore to assist you with this. Later, when you change or refactor the code (make it right), you can re-run this
    test case to make sure you didn't break that feature!
    </p>
    <h5>Documenting Your Project</h5>
    <p>Good documentation is an important aspect of any project - it explains what the project is, how it is built, and
      how to get started either using it or further developing it. All open source projects should have a detailed
      README in the root of the project directory that provides a high level overview of the project. (Here is a good
      reference for getting started with that. For more details about the project, sometimes a wiki can be useful. Most
      code repository tools like GitHub and GitLab have these built into the platform.</br>

      Also, you should write good documentation for not just the project as a whole, but for the code you write as well.
      You might not forget what your project does, but you probably will forget what that one function you wrote was
      meant for. Each language has the ability to include comments in the code, and you should use these to explain why
      you chose a certain approach or how the code functions. Comments should illuminate and summarize, not obfuscate.
      Don't over-comment or else it may be difficult to navigate through the file and inspect the code. If some of your
      code needs many comments to explain, it may be a sign you could write the code more cleanly another way or
      indicate you should refactor. Finally, there are some tools in each language that you can use to generate
      documentation from comments that you include on your classes, functions, or methods. For example, the Javadocs in
      Java will generate documentation when you use the /** ... */ multiline comments in your source code. </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Controll Flow </h2>
    <h5>BackGround Information</h5>
      <p>
        At its core a program is just a series of instructions that execute in a particular order.

The simplest programs run instructions one at a time starting at some specified beginning and finishing at a specified end point. Just like you might do if you were following a manual or recipe.

However, a program that can only do one set of instructions in the exact same way every single time is very limited.

What about when you only want to perform certain instructions in particular cases? Maybe you're simulating getting an ice cream and you want a user to be able to choose their flavor? What if you need to do a certain set of actions repeatedly?

With the style of programming described, it would be tough or impossible to execute certain instructions conditionally. And if you wanted to repeat a certain set of actions you would have to copy and paste the instructions however many times.

How do we solve this?

Control Flow or rather statements that control the flow of the program and allow a program to execute certain instructions conditionally and/or repeat instructions.
      </p>
    <h5>If Statement</h5>
    <p>The most fundamental way a program can execute certain instructions based on particular conditions is by using an if statement.
if(some condition){ </br>
    the stuff you want to do when the condition is true </br>
}</br>
</p> 
    <p>This means that you will check for some condition in between the parentheses. If it's true you will do "the stuff you want to do when the condition is true". </p>
    <p>
      With the if-else statement, we have a set of instructions that we do when the condition is true and a set we do when the condition is false. </br>
if (It's going to rain.){ </br>
    Wear rainboots and bring an umbrella.
} else{</br>
    Wear sunscreen and sunglasses. </br>
} </br>
    </p>
    <p>In the situation where we want to check for another possibility when the first possibility is false we can have an else-if statement. </br>

if (It's going to rain.){</br>
    Wear rainboots and bring an umbrella.</br>
} else if(It's going to be sunny){</br>
    Wear sunscreen and sunglasses.</br>
}else{</br>
    Do cloudy day activities.   </br>
}</br></br>
First the program checks if it's going to rain and then, only if the first condition is false, checks if it is going to be sunny.

Depending on which is true it will either have us "Wear rainboots and bring an umbrella.", "Wear sunscreen and sunglasses.", or "Do cloudy day activities.". We will always do one and only one of those options.

By "nesting" or putting if statements inside of if statements we can get even more complex logic, but the simple if statement is still the fundamental building block.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Loops </h3>
  <p>What if we want to repeat a set of instructions again and again?

This is where loops come into play.

** It's worth noting before we go any further that an if statement is not a loop. While we can place an if statment inside of a loop and we can "loop" based on certain conditions, it is incorrect to describe something as an "if-loop" or "if statement loop".</p>
  <p>A loop is section or "block" of code that repeats so long as a certain condition is true.</br> We typically group loops into three kinds while, do-while, and for (though how the loops are structured depends heavily on the programming language being used).
</p>
  <h5>While loops </h5>
  <p>while (some condition){</br>
    instructions</br>
    }</br>
</p>
  <h5>Do While Loop</h5>
  <p>do {</br>
    instructions</br>
}while(some condition)</br>
  In other words the condition is checked at the end. This means that a do-while loop will always execute at least once- even if the condition was never true.</p>
  <h5>For Loops</h5>
  <p>For loops are a little tricky because they are probably most different from one language to another.

That being said for loops are typically chosen when a developer knows going in that a loop should execute a set number of times or "iterate over" a particular collection.

** Note to iterate over a particular collection simply means if you have something like a list of items. You first get the first item in the list, then the next, then the next and so on until you have gone through the whole list.

A traditional for loop tends to follow this format:</p>
  <p>
for ( intialization statement; condition; update statement){<br>

    instructions</br>
}</br>
  <ul>
    <li>Initialization statement runs once at the beginning of the loop.
</li>
    <li> Condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration (an iteration is just a particular time the instructions run.)
</li>
    <li>Assuming the condition is true the instructions run.
</li>
    <li>The program gets to the bottom of the loop and then runs the update statement.</li>
    <li>The update statement finishes and the condition is checked. If it's true the instructions run again and the cycle continues.</li>
  </ul>
  for (x = 0 ; x < 3; x=x+1){ </br>
    print(x) </br>
} </br>
  </p>
  <h3>Let and Const Keywords</h3>
    <p>In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.

Variables declared with the let and const keyword can have Block Scope.</p>
    <h5>
      let keyword
    </h5>
    <p>The variables declared inside a block {} have Block Scope, so it can not be accessed from outside the block.</p>
    <h5>const keyword</h5>
    <p>const is block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let keyword. The value of a const variable can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared.
</p>
  </div>
    <div> 
    <h3>Methods and Functions</h3>
      <h5>
        Methods
      </h5>
      <p>Note: Function and method will be used interchangeably here, but typically you will use one or the other depending on the programming language.

A method or function in programming in its most basic form is just a named set of instructions.

Imagine you had a to-do list. It might look something like this:

do laundry
go grocery shopping
vacumm
Each of these things on the list could be considered a function or method.

On your to-do list, you don't write out every single step involved in "do laundry" or "go grocery shopping".

If you did your list might look more like:

Find all dirty clothes in the house and car.
Sort the dirty clothes into piles.
Put the first pile in the washing machine
Add soap
...
Instead you simply name that particular set of actions as "do laundry".

In some cases your set of actions requires some input that should be given at the time of execution. The input will be finalized when you or you the analogous program starts the task.

Think about grocery shopping for a minute. I might have grocery shopping on my to-do list every week, but I might have to buy a different set of items from the store each week. I might keep a separate list on the fridge just to track what I have run out of. The grocery list in this case would be the input to the "grocery shop" method.

Moreover, methods can also produce some results. Think of it this way I might buy all the stuff at the store, but unless I bring it I won't be able to use it. The bought groceries will just stay at the store.

Information in a method works in much the same way. Often our methods define a particular "scope"- a little bubble that is separate from the outside program. Unless we return information to the rest of the program.

Take this "grocery shop" function. It's outlined in rough psuedo code, but it should be fairly readable.There are a couple of key components that I want to draw your attention to.

First, all we have done here is outline what the groceryShop method is. If our fake program could actually run, it wouldn't do anything because we haven't actually "called" the method yet. (You might explain to your kids what doing the laundry is, but until you command them "do laundry" - nothing happens.)

Second, "grocery list" is a parameter (just a variable that gets its value in a special way). It's a place holder for the actual grocery list that would be needed when the program runs/calls/executes the "groceryShop" method.

The final key component that is often a source of confusion is the return statement or rather the portion that reads "return bought items list".

Common questions usually run along the lines of - isn't this the same as printing out the list? Where are we returning the items to?

Returning is within the context of the program. Perhaps the next function after grocery shop is make dinner. By returning the grocery items, you ensure that the rest of the program (outside the grocery shop method) gets access to the bought items. Then we can use these bought items for other things such as "make dinner".

      <h3>Study Guide</h3
      <h5>Integrated Design Environment</h5>
      <p>an IDE is a tool we use to write and test our code. Most IDEs will have the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            intelisense- informs you about syntax errors, gives helpful hints for what functions you can call, etc.
          </li>
          <li> 
            project explorer-
an overview of what folder you have open and all the sub directories and files contained within
          </li>
          <li>workspace- a window where you write your code. Intelisense help happens here</li>
<li>a way to execute your code-
in Visual Studio Code we have been using the comma</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h5>Terminal</h5>
      <p>
a terminal is a way of interacting with your computer via written commands. So far we have used the node command to execute our JavaScript files and the cd command to change our working directory to make it easier to execute our files</br>

working directory is where the terminal is operating in your file system. Any command you run (like node fileName.js) will automatically look for the file located in the working directory of the terminal. If you want to execute a command on a file located somewhere else you have to provide the path to that file (node folder1\folder2\file.js)
      </p>
      <h5>Runtime Environment
</h5>
      <p>A Runtime Environment is software that provides the means of executing your code. For JavaScript we are using the Node.js runtime environment. Node provides us with a way of executing JavaScript files from the command line by using the command "node". Node will then read, compile, and execute our file.</br>

compiling is the process of turning code from its human readable format into a machine-friendly format that your computer understands
</p>
      <ol>
        <li>string</li>
        <li>number</li>
        <li>bingint</li>
        <li>boolean</li>
        <li>null</li>
        <li>undefined</li>
        <li>symbol</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>Variable</h5>
      <p>creating variables is a way to easily reference data within your code dynamically. You can redefine variables whenever you want to have them reference new data. The standard naming convention for JavaScript variables and functions is camelCase. </p>
